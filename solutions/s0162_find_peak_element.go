	https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/

	A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

	Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
	If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

	You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

	You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
