/*
	https://leetcode.com/problems/using-a-robot-to-print-the-lexicographically-smallest-string/

	You are given a string s and a robot that currently holds an empty string t.
		Apply one of the following operations until s and t are both empty:

		Remove the first character of a string s and give it to the robot. The robot
			will append this character to the string t.
		Remove the last character of a string t and give it to the robot. The robot
			will write this character on paper.

	Return the lexicographically smallest string that can be written on the paper.
