/*
	https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-even-and-odd-frequency-i/

	You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

	Your task is to find the maximum difference diff = freq(a1) - freq(a2) between the frequency of characters a1 and a2 in the string such that:

		a1 has an odd frequency in the string.
		a2 has an even frequency in the string.

	Return this maximum difference.
